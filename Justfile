# Aztec AVM Runtime — verification entry points.
#
# Every recipe here is a real, runnable check that fails loudly. None of them
# skip: a check that cannot run in the current environment exits non-zero with
# a reason, it never prints "SKIP" and reports success.
#
# The M0 verification set (see
# codetracer-specs/Planned-Work/Aztec-AVM-Runtime.milestones.org):
#
#   just check-repo-hygiene            flake + lock + .envrc + no uncommitted generated files
#   just verify-devshell-runtime       verify_nix_devshell_aztec_avm_runtime
#   just verify-devshell-fork          verify_nix_devshell_aztec_packages_fork
#   just verify-exception-flags        verify_wasi_sdk_33_exception_flags
#   just verify-diffsim                verify_diffsim_runs_in_devshell
#   just verify-workspace-registration verify_workspace_repos_registered
#   just verify-m0                     all six, in order
#
# The sibling fork is expected at ../aztec-packages (a workspace-root sibling,
# the M0 layout decision). The checks fail if it is not there.
